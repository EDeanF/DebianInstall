Initial Starting Point
======================
	the following resources are a great starting point
	for installing Debian for the first time
	
	Average Linux User
		https://averagelinuxuser.com/
	The ArchLinux wiki appears much better managed than the Debian wiki
		https://wiki.archlinux.org
	Don't Call Me Lenny!

About Computer
==============
Laptop:		Gigabyte Aero 15
Distro:		Debian 9 Stretch
Desktop:	xfce4

Installation
============
Mostly follow Average Linux User's guide to installation

Deactivate SecureBoot
	Go into the BIOS menu (reboot and spam F2)
	Go to the Security Tab and Deactivate SecureBoot

Partition
	30GB root
	16GB swap
	the rest is for home

	You will need to do this manually to keep home
	Just double click each partition
		Use as: Ext4 journaling file system
		Mount point: / or home
	For swap
		Use as: swap area

Installing base
	fresh install of Debian 10 does not work
	will just install Debian 9 for now
	Installing xfce4 using the installation GUI breaks on Aero 15
	I just install the base (standard system utilities only) and then install dekstop later

Add Repositories
	Add contrib and non-free repositories
	Add stretch-backports for more updated software
	apt-get update
	apt-get upgrade
	apt-get dist-upgrade

Add 32bit architecture
	dpkg --add-architecture i386

Add headers
	apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r|sed 's,[^-]*-[^-]*-,,')
	It is a good excercise to enter "uname -r" into the terminal
	Read the documentation for sed. You should have a better idea what this code is doing

Firmware
	apt-get install firmware-linux intel-microcode

Internet
	apt-get install network-manager network-manager-gnome firmware-iwlwifi
	apt-get install firefox-esr

	update /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf

	Sources:
		https://wiki.debian.org/iwlwifi
	
	Setup Firewall	
		sudo apt-get install ufw
		sudo ufw enable
		sudo ufw status verbose

Desktop
	sudo apt-get install xfce4 xfce4-goodies

Edit Grub File
	useful if you are dual booting

	/etc/default/grub
	GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
	GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true
	update-grub2
	
	Sources:	
		https://wiki.debian.org/Grub

Improve Touchpad
	sudo mk /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-touchpad.conf
	
	Sources:
		https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Libinput
		https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/libinput.4

Disabling Nouveau Drivers
	There are problems running nouveau drivers. For example, running lspci causes crash
	To blacklist the nouveau drivers
	sudo mk /etc/modprobe.d/nouveau_blacklist.conf
	Use your favorite text-editor to write: blacklist nouveau
	Look up "Nouveau Drivers" in the ArchWiki for more info

Power Management / Discrete Graphics
====================================

It would seem that this is the most difficult part of any linux installation
As such, this section is very much a work in progress

A naked install of Debian with xfce desktop results in a battery life of around 4 hours.

You can double the battery life by installing bbswitch to shut off the graphics card
You will need to confirm bbswitch in order to have it automatically run upon booting up
Or you can make your life easier by installing bumblebee, which will also disable nouveau
	sudo apt-get install bumblebee

Installing bbswitch
	sudo apt-get install bbswitch-dkms

	To have bbswitch run automatically on boot, you need to create two files
	One for kmod and one for systemd:
	(1) /etc/modprobe.d/bbswitch.conf
	(2) /etc/modules-load.d/bbswitch.conf
	see https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/bbswitch for details
	Editing /etc/modules causes an error for systemd

Problem with light-locker
	If you are presented with a black screen after screensaver, suspending, or hibernating
	To get to the login screen TTY7 (i.e. Ctrl+Alt+F7) and then TTY8 (Ctrl+Alt+F8)

	It turns out that this is a very well documented problem in light-locker
	see https://github.com/the-cavalry/light-locker/issues/138
	editing /usr/bin/xflock4 only seems to help when hibernating from xfce logout GUI

Suspend
	Suspend has some very weird behavior.
	I can suspend once using either xfce GUI or systemctrl, 
	but the second time freezes everything. Cannot even TTY

Instructions
	plank				docker
					Open Window Manger Tweaks. 
					Under Composition tab, uncheck 
						"Show shadows under dock windows"
					This will get rid of the weird line
	torbrowser-launcher		requires debian-backports
