Initial Starting Point
======================
	the following resources are a great starting point for installing Debian Stretch
	for the first time

	Don't Call Me Lenny!

	The ArchLinux wiki appears much better managed than the Debian wiki
		https://wiki.archlinux.org

About Computer
==============
Laptop:		Gigabyte Aero 15
Distro:		Debian Stretch 
Desktop:	xfce

Installation
============
Deactivate SecureBoot
	Go into the BIOS menu (reboot and spam F2)
	Go to the Security Tab and Deactivate SecureBoot

Follow Average Linux User's guide to installation

Add contrib and non-free repositories
Add stretch-backports for more updated software
	
Add 32bit architecture
	dpkg --add-architecture i386

Add headers
	apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r|sed 's,[^-]*-[^-]*-,,')
	It is a good excersise to entire "uname -r" into the terminal
	Read the documentation for sed. You should have a better idea what this code is doing

Default install includes network manager, but need to install driver for wireless card
	https://wiki.debian.org/iwlwifi
	sudo apt-get install firmware-iwlwifi

Install firewall
	sudo apt-get install ufw
	sudo ufw enable
	sudo ufw status verbose

Improve Touchpad 
	sudo mk /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-touchpad.conf
	
	sources:
		https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Libinput
		https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/libinput.4

edit grub to save last booted drive
	useful if you are dual booting

	/etc/default/grub
	GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
	GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true
	update-grub2
	see https://wiki.debian.org/Grub

Add PulseAudioPlugin to Panel1
	Allows you to use Fn keys for volume control

Power Management / Discrete Graphics
====================================

It would seem that this is the most difficult part of any linux installation
As such, this section is very much a work in progress

A naked install of Debian with xfce desktop results in a battery life of around 4 hours.

You can double the battery life by installing bbswitch and disabling the nouveau drivers

Or you can make your life a lot easier by installing bumblebee, which will do both of these tasks
	sudo apt-get install bumblebee

Installing bbswitch
	sudo apt-get install bbswitch-dkms

	You then need to load the module
	sudo modprobe bbswitch load_state=0

	If you like, you can also configure bbswitch to disable the card upon boot
	You need to do ALL the tasks listed in "Disable card on boot" in the README file
	You can find the README file for bbswitch in the bumblebee github

Disabling Nouveau Drivers
	After a fresh install of Debian stretch, it seems that this is not necessary
	I could also use bbswitch to turn the graphics card on and off after a fresh install

	However, after some point, the Nouveau driver stopped working
	I have not tested this yet, but it may have something to do with booting into Windows.
	The Nouveau Drivers seemed to work fine until after I booted into Windows and then back into Linux
	After booting into Windows, the Nouveau drivers stopped working, and bbswitch could no longer 
		change the state of the graphics card

	To blacklist the nouveau drivers
	sudo mk /etc/modprobe.d/nouveau_blacklist.conf
	use your favorite text-editor to write: blacklist nouveau
	You can look up "Nouveau Drivers" in the ArchWiki for more info

After installing bbswitch, suspend and hibernate no longer work
	I'm not exactly sure why this is the case. 
	In the meantime, you can get around the problem by unloading the bbswitch module before suspending or hibernating
	You can automatically unload/load bbswitch before/after suspending or hibernating by making a file in the directory
		/lib/systemd/system-sleep/
	Don't forget to make the file executable by going into root and using chmod +x filename
	For more information read: man systemd-suspend.service

	For whatever reason, suspend still does not work.
	More specifically, the screen freezes if you try to automatically load the bbswitch module after suspending.
	If you unload the bbswitch before suspending, and don't automatically load bbswitch after suspending, 
		it works fine, aside from the fact that you have the manually load bbswitch to improve battery life
	I have set my computer to always hibernate instead using xfce-power-manager. 
		It takes more time to wake up, but it is okay for now.
	
Personalize
===========
These are mostly cosmetic customizations

Keyboard Shortcuts
	Command				Shortcut
	------------------------------------------
	xfce4-terminal			Ctrl+Alt+T
	xfce4-popup-whiskermenu		Super L
	firefox				Ctrl+Alt+F

Window Manager
	Style: Button Layout: remove shade and maximize
	Advanced:Windows snapping: To other windows
	Advanced:Wrap workspaces when reaching the screen edge

Panel
	Remove Panel 2
	Customize Panel 1
		Display tab
			Measurements: Row Size 50
		Items tab
			Window Buttons: hide button labels, always group windows
			Workspace Switcher: number of rows=2
			Clock: Layout=LCD
			Notification Area: Maximum Icon Size 50

Appearance
	Xfce-dusk

Recommended programs
====================
sudo apt-get install xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin intel-microcode vim g++ git xpdf keepass2

xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin	like Windows start menu

intel-microcode

vim

g++				C++ compiler

git				version managment

xpdf				for pdf viewer

keepass2			password manager

plank				dock
				Open Window Manger Tweaks. 
				Under Composition tab, uncheck "Show shadows under dock windows"
				this will get rid of the weird line

torbrwoser-aluncher		requires debian-backports

Unresolved Problems
===================

Have not tried to use graphics card
Most Fn buttons not detected

Backup
======

firefox		places.sqlite, prefs.js
