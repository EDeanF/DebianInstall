Initial Starting Point
======================
	the following resources are a great starting point
	for installing Debian for the first time
	
	Average Linux User
		https://averagelinuxuser.com/
	The ArchLinux wiki appears much better managed than the Debian wiki
		https://wiki.archlinux.org
	Don't Call Me Lenny!

About Computer
==============
Laptop:		Gigabyte Aero 15
Distro:		Debian 10 Buster 
Desktop:	xfce4

Installation
============
Mostly follow Average Linux User's guide to installation

Deactivate SecureBoot
	Go into the BIOS menu (reboot and spam F2)
	Go to the Security Tab and Deactivate SecureBoot

Partition
	30GB root
	16GB swap
	the rest is for home

	You will need to do this manually to keep home
	Just double click each partition
		Use as: Ext4 journaling file system
		Mount point: / or home
	For swap
		Use as: swap area

Installing base
	Installing xfce4 using the installation GUI breaks on Aero 15
	I just install the base (standard system utilities only) and then install dekstop later
	I was unable to get bbswitch to work with testing, so I will stick with buster

Add Repositories
	Add contrib and non-free repositories
	Add stretch-backports for more updated software
	apt-get update
	apt-get upgrade
	apt-get dist-upgrade

Add 32bit architecture
	dpkg --add-architecture i386

Add headers
	apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r|sed 's,[^-]*-[^-]*-,,')
	It is a good excercise to enter "uname -r" into the terminal
	Read the documentation for sed. You should have a better idea what this code is doing

Firmware
	apt-get install firmware-linux intel-microcode

Internet
	apt-get install network-manager network-manager-gnome firmware-iwlwifi
	apt-get install firefox-esr

	Sources:
		https://wiki.debian.org/iwlwifi
	
	Setup Firewall	
		sudo apt-get install ufw
		sudo ufw enable
		sudo ufw status verbose

Desktop
	sudo apt-get install xfce4 xfce4-goodies

Edit Grub File
	useful if you are dual booting

	/etc/default/grub
	GRUB_DEFAULT=saved
	GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true
	update-grub2
	
	Sources:	
		https://wiki.debian.org/Grub

Improve Touchpad
	sudo mk /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-touchpad.conf
	
	Sources:
		https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Libinput
		https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/libinput.4

Disabling Nouveau Drivers
	There are problems running nouveau drivers. For example, running lspci causes crash
	To blacklist the nouveau drivers
	sudo mk /etc/modprobe.d/nouveau_blacklist.conf
	Use your favorite text-editor to write: blacklist nouveau
	Look up "Nouveau Drivers" in the ArchWiki for more info

Power Management / Discrete Graphics
====================================

It would seem that this is the most difficult part of any linux installation
As such, this section is very much a work in progress

A naked install of Debian with xfce desktop results in a battery life of around 4 hours.

You can double the battery life by installing bbswitch to shut off the graphics card
You will need to confirm bbswitch in order to have it automatically run upon booting up
Or you can make your life easier by installing bumblebee, which will also disable nouveau
	sudo apt-get install bumblebee

Installing bbswitch
	sudo apt-get install bbswitch-dkms

	You then need to load the module
	sudo modprobe bbswitch load_state=0

	If you like, you can also configure bbswitch to disable the card upon boot
	You need to do ALL the tasks listed in "Disable card on boot" in the README file
	You can find the README file for bbswitch in the bumblebee github

After installing bbswitch, suspend and hibernate no longer work
	I'm not sure why this is the case. 
	In the meantime, you can get around the problem by unloading the bbswitch module before suspending or hibernating
	You can automatically unload/load bbswitch before/after suspending or hibernating by making a file in the directory
		/lib/systemd/system-sleep/
	Don't forget to make the file executable by going into root and using chmod +x filename
	For more information read: man systemd-suspend.service
	
	After hibernating, you may be presented with a blank screen. 
	Most of the time, if you switch to TTY7 (Ctrl+Alt+F7) and then TTY8, you will get the login screen
	But sometimes it still doesn't work

Personalize
===========
These are mostly cosmetic customizations

Programs
====================
Debian-Repositories

media		apt-get install libreoffice vlc inkscape xpdf
